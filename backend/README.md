# WhatsGPT Backend

Backend would serve the following purposes:
- [Stage 1] Serve a webhook that receives messages from Whatsapp API.
- [Stage 1] Log every message and response to Database.
- [Stage 1] Respond to messages with an echo.
- [Stage 2] Pipe every message to OpenAI GPT-3.
- [Stage 2] Respond to messages with response from GPT-3.
- [Stage 3] Convert message to machine language syntax.
- [Stage 3] Pipe syntax to processor against realtime data.
- [Stage 3] Respond to message with results of syntax processing.

These are broad points at this stage and may change as needed, however, they are laid as roadmap for Backend.
